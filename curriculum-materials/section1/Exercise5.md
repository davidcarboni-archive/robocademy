### Exercise Title
You've turned a corner!

### Educational Text
What, you're bored with only making the robot go forwards? Not a problem, lets learn how to turn.

Turning happend when one wheel moves faster thatn the other. If the right wheen moves faster than the left wheel the the robot turnsleft. If the left wheel mvoes faster then the right wheel, the the robot turns right.

Got it?

Even better, you already know how to change the speed of the motors.

To give instructions to each motor separately you need to write the following code...

### Exercise Instructions
Get the robot to turn right, stop, and then turn left. 

### Hint
If you drive one motor faster than the other, the robot will turn. If the left motor goes faster, will the robot turn left or right?

### Default Code

    // Please don't edit these placeholders:
    function drive(){}
    function stop(){}
    // Thank you
    
    drive(3, 7, 1);
