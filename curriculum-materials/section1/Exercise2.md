### Exercise Title
How far? how fast?

### Educational Text
Wouldn't it be good if we could tell the robot how far to travel? Guess what? We can!

Now you're going to have to combine what you've learnt in coding with some maths skills and do an experiment. 

You can tell the motor how long to stay on for by writing the following code...

You'll need the following equipment
1) Your robot
2) a pencil
3) a ruler
4) a large piece of paper
5) A table to record your results in (read the method and then draw this ready for the experiment)

Follow the following method
1) Put the robot on the paper close to 1 edge
2) mark the robot's starting position
3) Run the code that makes it travel for 2 seconds
4) Mark it's finish position
5) Measure how far it has travelled
6) Repeat for 4,6,8,10 and 12 seconds
7) Cary out appropriate repeats
7) Draw a graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y axis
8) Calculate the gradient of the graph - this is the robot's speed


### Exercise Instructions
Write some code that gets the robot to travel forward for:

a) 2 seconds
b) 4 seconds
c) 6 seconds
d) 8 seconds
e) 10 seconds
f) 12 seconds

### Hint

### Default Code

    // Please don't edit these placeholders:
    function drive(){}
    function stop(){}
    // Thank you
    
    drive(5, 5, 2);
    drive(5, 5, 4);
    drive(5, 5, 6);
    // What goes next?

### Submission Correctness Test

    // For the moment, accept any solution.
    // This needs to be developed.
    return true;
