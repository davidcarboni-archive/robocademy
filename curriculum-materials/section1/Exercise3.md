### Exercise Title
Go the distance!

### Educational Text
Fantastic, now you know how fast your robot goes, you can make it go any distance you like... as long as you know the equation:

distance = speed/time

so we've decided what distance we want our robot to go and we know how fast it travel, we just need to know how long to tell the motors to run for.

You've probably already worked out how to that by rearranging the equation to

time = distance/speed

(and I've done it for you if you hadn't)

OK, so lets see if you can make the robot travel a specific distance!

### Exercise Instructions
Write some code that will make the robot travel:
a) 10 cm
b) 4cm
c) 200mm
d) 0.5m

### Hint

### Default Code
    drive(64, 64, 1.7);
    // What values do you need for your robot?

### Submission Correctness Test

    // For the moment, accept any solution.
    // This needs to be developed.
    return true;
